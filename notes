shell/CLI - command line interface, allows user to interact with hardware
shell is also a command language interpreter that executes commands read for the standard input device
prompt
pwd  print working directory
/etc/    top level directory, contains files to configure the system
sudo  superuser do (do as superuser)
apt-get  advanced package tool, front end tool for dpkg, Debian package management tool
finger  find out information about users
pinky  lightweight finger
dependency  use package management systems to do dependency checking
dpkg -L  to get list of file locations
dpkg -ql  for locations of application files
apt-get update   update list of available packages when using dpkg
apt-cache depends package    list dependencies of dpkg package
dpkg -purge   will completely remove files including config
etc/apt/sources.list   file edited to select network locations from which installation packages are loaded
dpkg-reconfigure   asks config questions for specific installed package as if it were being installed for the first time
command -parameter -option -switch /directory/file
  all are case sensitive
type - tells you if it's an internal or external command
apropos - lets you search man pages

(Nicole's notes)
To do:
Send email for slack channel braindumps for our tests ctrl f search the PDF
Find a good linux terminal or set up a vm

Know the difference between internal and external command!
Why would you care?
echo $PATH try this and paste what you see


ls  means list  as in list of files
ls -l means long and list more information
ls -la shows all files including hidden ones
ls -lA excludes dot files for security measures
man ls look up correct syntax
less displays text for you to read. Use q to exit

There are 8 sections to the man pages. (manual)
1 user commands
2 kernel system calls
3 library calls - a library code that can be reused over and over
4 device files,nodes, and driers for all your hardware in your system /dev  cd /dev
5 file formats
6 games, screen savers
7 misc macros (little scripts)
8 sysadmin commands used only by root

$man 5 passwd file format of passwd file 
$apropos display appropriate commands
$man -k  is apropos gives you system info (same as above)
know internal commands
cd 
pwd 
echo prints text on screen
exec
time
set
exit
logout
uname tells you info on kernel and hostname 
type -a pwd

Type will tell you if an command is internal or external
./filename execute the file in the current directory (be careful) don’t need path don’t use it.

Absolute path/blah/blah
Relative path begins with . or ..(shortcut)
.. is the parent of your working directory
Shortcuts only go up directory
To go down you must use absolute path

Two easy ways to get back to your homedir!
cd $HOME
cd (enter)
spooled (look this up)
Know the top level directories!

Command completion: type and hit tab
Maximum filename length is 255 (remember this)
$history can show you (limit 500 by default)
$history | tail will show last 10 lines by default (pipeline) (~/.base_history)
$history 30 shows last 30 commands
$!297 executes the command at #297
$history -c clears history to clear passwords etc
$!! Shows the last command like the up arrow (! is called bang) (check this)google

Tip! Review the keyboard shortcut keys for the linux test

User account based security - 2 types of users
regular user ($): created by default when Ubuntu is installed
superuser privileges (#): root in most distros, disabled in Ubuntu
  *Ubuntu - first user created - superuser privileges
  *To make system-wide change, enter sudo and your password
  *For superuser privileges throughout a session, $sudo -i (allows limited superuser privileges to specific users)
  *to return to regular user prompt, type exit & enter
Most flavors of Linus use su to switch users
  *To become root, enter root password, or password of other user
  *$sudo bash -  become root for single cmd - use your password
  *whoami
  *su temporarily switches you to a new shell. If no name specified, you become root user account &  requires root user's pword (exit returns your shell to regular prompt)

config files are plain-text
bash configs are shell scripts
~/.bashrc & ~/.profile main user config files for bash
/etc/bash.bashrc & /etc/profile main global config files
May add dirs to $PATH environmental variable(colon-delimited)
Backup files (xxx.old) before making any changes
Test changes by logging into another virtual terminal
Variable are given names & stores temporarily in memory
When you close terminal window or shell, are variables are lost
System automatically recreates many variables when new shell is opened

~ is home directory
/ is root directory

rc stands for resource configuration
when editing .bashrc, comment things out

Two types of variable used to bash shell:
Environmental variables (ex: PATH and HOME) - used by bash when interpreting commands and performing tasks
Local variables are often associated with used-based tasks
